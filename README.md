Texchange is a website to facilitate the transferring and selling of old college textbooks from upperclassmen to underclassmen. It uses a facebook marketplace-esque system where users create their own accounts and post listings where other users can see and message them to meet up to buy/sell used textbooks. 

For security, only users with .edu accounts that are verified are allowed to make an account and see listings.
